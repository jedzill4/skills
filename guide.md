# Scaffolding — Agentic Install Guide

This is the judgment layer for the `scaffolding` bootstrap. The deterministic
work (clean-adds, gating, the plan) lives in the CLI; your job as the agent is to
drive that CLI, surface the decisions the **user** must own, and handle the
merges the CLI deliberately refuses to do.

Point an agent at the raw URL of this file and have it follow every step:

`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jedzill4/scaffolding/main/guide.md`

For a brand-new/empty repo you can skip the agent and run the CLI directly
(clean adds only; it refuses to touch existing files):

```bash
uvx --from git+https://github.com/jedzill4/scaffolding scaffolding install
# or the shim (also bootstraps uv):
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jedzill4/scaffolding/main/install.sh | bash
```

The CLI is **clean-adds-only**: it never edits, merges, reorders, or overwrites
existing files. Existing targets are reported as `[defer]` and left untouched —
those are yours to merge, per this guide.

## Model A flow (how to drive the CLI)

1. **Inspect + plan.** Run `scaffolding plan --json`. You get
   `{facts, clean_adds, runs, skips, defers, decisions_needed, deferred_merges,
   notices}`. `facts` is the Tier-0 detection (git root, python?, Dockerfile?,
   visibility, available tools). `defers`/`deferred_merges` are the existing
   files you'll merge by hand.
2. **Surface decisions to the user.** For each entry in `decisions_needed`, ask
   the user — do not pick for them (see the taxonomy below). Typical keys:
   `agents`, `pyproject_name`, `pyproject_description`, `ci_parts`, `varlock`.
3. **Apply clean-adds.** Run
   `scaffolding install --yes <answers as flags>` (e.g. `--agent opencode
   --agent claude-code --name foo --ci --ci-parts tests,security`). `--yes` keeps
   it non-interactive; your gathered answers come in as flags. `--agent` is
   repeatable / comma-separated — pass every agent the user targets.
4. **Handle merges yourself.** For every `defer`, additively merge per the
   per-area rules below. This is the part that needs judgment — the CLI won't do
   it.
5. **Verify.** Run `scaffolding check` (nonzero exit on any failure) and
   `scaffolding doctor` for environment issues.

For a new/empty repo with no defers and no policy decisions, just run
`scaffolding install` and you're done.

## New vs. existing repos

**New or empty repo (clean setup).** No conflicting `.gitignore`, `opencode.jsonc`,
`prek.toml`, `AGENTS.md`, or `.env*`/`.env.schema`? Run `scaffolding install`
directly — apply every default, install skills, run `varlock init`, no
negotiation.

**Existing working repo (migration).** When any of those exist, do not silently
change an active project. Run `scaffolding plan --json` first, then present a
short installation plan and wait for the user's go-ahead, sorting every change
into three buckets:

- **Clean adds** — missing files/entries the CLI applies safely (a missing
  `.gitignore` line, a brand-new `opencode.jsonc`). Apply via `scaffolding
  install` once approved.
- **Merges** — additive edits to existing files (missing keys in
  `opencode.jsonc`, extra `prek.toml` hooks, the `AGENTS.md` section, new
  `pyproject.toml` tool sections). These show up as `defer`. Merge by hand; show
  what gets inserted and confirm no collisions.
- **Conflicts** — anything that would remove, replace, reorder, or restructure
  existing content, or where the user's value differs. Never auto-resolve; let
  the user decide per item and default to the most conservative option.

## Non-destructive edits (the merge contract)

- If a file exists, update it in place by adding only the missing entries.
- If a key already exists in `opencode.jsonc`, preserve its value and merge only
  missing nested keys or array items.
- If a change would remove, rename, replace, or restructure existing content,
  stop and ask the user first.
- Do not normalize formatting across a whole file just because it differs from
  the templates.

## Decision taxonomy (who decides what)

- **Tier 0 — Facts** (auto-detected, never asked): git root, python?,
  Dockerfile?, repo visibility, available tools.
- **Tier 1 — Clean-adds** (the CLI applies): gitignore lines, `opencode.jsonc`,
  prek hooks, ast-grep config, the `AGENTS.md` section when absent.
- **Tier 2 — Policy** (the USER decides, even on agentic install): CI opt-in and
  which parts; agent target(s) — any of `opencode`/`claude-code`/`codex`, one or
  more; `pyproject` name and description; skill set. Surface these from
  `decisions_needed`.
- **Tier 3 — Destructive** (USER, explicit confirm; default skip): `varlock init`
  when `.env.example`/`.env.schema` exists; `docker.yml` on a private/internal
  repo (GHCR billing). The CLI skips these with a notice unless told otherwise.
- **Tier 4 — Merges/conflicts** (your judgment): key-level merges into existing
  `opencode.jsonc`/`pyproject.toml`, updating an existing `AGENTS.md` section,
  clashing `.gitignore` handling. Always deferred by the CLI.

## Per-area merge rules

When a target is `deferred`, fetch the bundled template and merge additively.
Templates are bundled in the package; the raw URLs below are the fallback when
you need the content to merge by hand.

### `.gitignore`

Ensure these are present at the repo root (the CLI adds missing ones; merge by
hand only if the file conflicts). Keep `.env.schema` tracked:

```
.env
!.env.schema
.tmp/
.scratch/
.worktrees/
.journals/
```

### `prek.toml`

Additive only. Generic hooks always; Python hooks
([prek-python.toml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jedzill4/scaffolding/main/scaffolding/templates/prek-python.toml))
only for Python repos. Templates:

- [prek-generic.toml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jedzill4/scaffolding/main/scaffolding/templates/prek-generic.toml)
- [prek-python.toml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jedzill4/scaffolding/main/scaffolding/templates/prek-python.toml)
- [pyproject-template.toml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jedzill4/scaffolding/main/scaffolding/templates/pyproject-template.toml)

If a Python repo has no `pyproject.toml`, the CLI creates one from the template
with a guided `name`/`description`. If it exists, only add missing tool sections —
never replace dependencies or project metadata without explicit approval.

### `ast-grep`

The `ast-grep` hook in `prek-python.toml` runs `ast-grep scan`, which needs a
root `sgconfig.yml` pointing at a rule dir. The CLI auto-includes `ast-grep` when
`prek` is selected on a Python repo. When merging by hand, add both additively:

- [sgconfig-template.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jedzill4/scaffolding/main/scaffolding/templates/sgconfig-template.yml) → root `sgconfig.yml` (`ruleDirs: [ast-grep/rules]`)
- starter rules from [templates/ast-grep-rules/](https://github.com/jedzill4/scaffolding/tree/main/scaffolding/templates/ast-grep-rules) → `ast-grep/rules/` (`no-dict-call-return`, `no-dict-literal-return`, `no-dict-return-annotation`).

### GitHub Actions CI

Opt-in (Tier 2). `scaffolding install ci --ci-parts tests,security,docker,publish`
selects parts. House style derived from `aymurai-asr`: `astral-sh/setup-uv@v5`
pinned, `actions/checkout@v4`, a `concurrency` group, least-privilege
`permissions`. Templates:

- [zizmor.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jedzill4/scaffolding/main/scaffolding/templates/github/workflows/zizmor.yml) — workflow static analysis (any repo).
- [tests.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jedzill4/scaffolding/main/scaffolding/templates/github/workflows/tests.yml) — lint/type-check/test (Python `uv` repos).
- [pip-audit.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jedzill4/scaffolding/main/scaffolding/templates/github/workflows/pip-audit.yml) — dependency vuln scan (Python `uv` repos).
- [dependabot.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jedzill4/scaffolding/main/scaffolding/templates/github/dependabot.yml) — weekly updates (Python `uv` repos).
- [docker.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jedzill4/scaffolding/main/scaffolding/templates/github/workflows/docker.yml) — build/push to GHCR. Added only with a root `Dockerfile` **and** a public repo; the CLI skips it on private/internal repos with a GHCR-billing notice.
- Publish-only (opt-in, placeholders to fill): [release.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jedzill4/scaffolding/main/scaffolding/templates/github/workflows/release.yml), [pypi.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jedzill4/scaffolding/main/scaffolding/templates/github/workflows/pypi.yml) — public Python packages with Trusted Publishing only.

Never overwrite an existing workflow; if a target exists, leave it and suggest
additive changes the user approves. Bump stale pinned action/tool versions.

### Per-agent config

The `agent-config` component writes config for each selected agent. `AGENTS.md`
(see below) is the shared brain read by **opencode** and **codex**; **claude-code**
is the exception — it reads `CLAUDE.md` + `.claude/skills`, so it is bridged with
symlinks.

- **opencode** → repo-root `opencode.jsonc` from
  [opencode-template.jsonc](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jedzill4/scaffolding/main/scaffolding/templates/opencode-template.jsonc).
  Merge additively: add only missing keys, plugin entries, and permission rules;
  preserve the user's values. Sets `$schema`, the `opencode-sessions-explorer` and
  `opencode-varlock@latest` plugins, and `permission` rules denying secret access
  (`.env*`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, `*credentials*`, `varlock.config`).
- **claude-code** → `.claude/settings.json` from
  [claude-settings-template.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jedzill4/scaffolding/main/scaffolding/templates/claude-settings-template.json)
  (a `permissions.deny`/`allow` mirror of the opencode secret rules), plus two
  clean-adds-only symlinks: `CLAUDE.md` → `AGENTS.md` and `.claude/skills` →
  `.agents/skills`. If either path already exists it is deferred — bridge by hand
  (never clobber). Merge `.claude/settings.json` additively into any existing file.
- **codex** → no repo-local file. Codex reads `AGENTS.md` natively and has no
  per-file deny-list; protection is varlock + AGENTS.md guidance + the leak-scan
  hook, plus user-level `~/.codex/config.toml` (`sandbox_mode="workspace-write"`,
  `approval_policy="on-request"`). See *Secret protection per agent* below.

### Secret protection per agent

`varlock init` is agent-agnostic (it only creates `.env.schema` and gitignores
`.env*`). The live context-redaction plugin (`opencode-varlock`) is **OpenCode-only**.

| Layer | opencode | claude-code | codex |
|---|---|---|---|
| `.env.schema` committed, `.env*` gitignored | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Repo-local read/bash deny-list | `opencode.jsonc` | `.claude/settings.json` | — (none) |
| Live context redaction plugin | `opencode-varlock` | — | — |
| AGENTS.md / varlock-skill guidance | ✅ | ✅ (via CLAUDE.md) | ✅ |
| Leak pre-commit hook (prek) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

For codex, tell the user: never `cat .env` (use `varlock load`), rely on the
AGENTS.md rules + leak-scan hook, and harden `~/.codex/config.toml`
(`sandbox_mode`, `approval_policy`) — there is no live-redaction equivalent.

### Varlock secret management

Use [Varlock](https://varlock.dev) so secrets stay out of the repo and out of
agent context. Tier 3 — never overwrite an existing `.env.schema`/`.env` without
explicit approval. The CLI runs `varlock init` (or `npx varlock init --agent`)
only when no `.env.schema` exists; otherwise it defers. Commit `.env.schema`,
never `.env`.

### `AGENTS.md`

The core task: the managed `## Repo Workspace Defaults` section, copied verbatim
from [agents-workspace-defaults.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jedzill4/scaffolding/main/scaffolding/templates/agents-workspace-defaults.md).
The CLI appends it when absent and skips when the marker is present. If the
section exists but needs changes, update only the lines inside it and preserve
everything else. Do not edit `CLAUDE.md` during bootstrap unless asked.

## Skill installation

Skills install **once** into the shared `.agents/skills` standard (read by
opencode + codex). When `claude-code` is selected, the `agent-config` component's
`.claude/skills` → `.agents/skills` symlink makes the same skills visible to
Claude — do **not** re-run the installer per agent. Install the curated upstream
skills, then this repo's recurring local skills (`journalist`, `handoff`):

```bash
npx skills add mattpocock/skills --agent opencode --yes --skill setup-matt-pocock-skills diagnose grill-with-docs triage improve-codebase-architecture tdd to-issues to-prd zoom-out prototype grill-me write-a-skill
npx skills add jedzill4/scaffolding --agent opencode --yes --skill journalist handoff
npx skills add dmno-dev/varlock --agent opencode --yes
```

From a local checkout, install local skills with
`npx skills add . --agent opencode --yes --skill journalist handoff --full-depth`.

After installing, run the `setup-matt-pocock-skills` skill once to configure the
repo (issue tracker, triage labels, domain docs) that the other engineering
skills assume. The upstream skill defaults the issue tracker to GitHub; for this
workspace **default it to local markdown** (issues under `.scratch/<feature>/`),
since these repos are solo/agent-driven. Only set up GitHub, GitLab, or another
tracker when the user explicitly wants it.

## Verify

Run `scaffolding check` — it asserts the completeness checklist (gitignore
entries incl. `!.env.schema`; prek `betterleaks` hook; `.env.schema` tracked and
`.env` ignored; ast-grep config when the hook is present; the `AGENTS.md` section,
which is the only universal requirement). Agent config is validated **only when
present**: `opencode.jsonc` (schema/plugin/permission), `.claude/settings.json`
(secret `permissions.deny`), and `CLAUDE.md` → `AGENTS.md`. Then confirm any
deferred merges you applied by hand preserved all existing content, and that no
existing file, key, array item, or comment was removed without explicit user
approval.
