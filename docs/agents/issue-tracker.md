# Issue tracker: Local Markdown

Issues and PRDs for this repo live as markdown files in `.scratch/`.

This is the default for this workspace (solo / agent-driven repos). It can be
switched to GitHub, GitLab, or another tracker later by re-running the
`setup-matt-pocock-skills` skill — this repo does have a GitHub remote
(`jedzill4/scaffolding`), so GitHub is a valid alternative if you want it.

## Conventions

- One feature per directory: `.scratch/<feature-slug>/`
- The PRD is `.scratch/<feature-slug>/PRD.md`
- Implementation issues are `.scratch/<feature-slug>/issues/<NN>-<slug>.md`, numbered from `01`
- Triage state is recorded as a `Status:` line near the top of each issue file (see `triage-labels.md` for the role strings)
- Comments and conversation history append to the bottom of the file under a `## Comments` heading

## When a skill says "publish to the issue tracker"

Create a new file under `.scratch/<feature-slug>/` (creating the directory if needed).

## When a skill says "fetch the relevant ticket"

Read the file at the referenced path. The user will normally pass the path or the issue number directly.
